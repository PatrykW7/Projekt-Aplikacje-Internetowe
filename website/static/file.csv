14,"BTW, microwaves can obliterate WiFi latency by forcing to repeat messages at a level that won't show as packet loss, but jitter.

16,"No. You haven't tested the game's latency. Or just on a local scale. Your testing makes sense only for offline games, but CS2 is an online game, right? It's like shooting a running deer by looking at a video that someone sent you a few moments ago and thinking that since you can move the gun in real time, everything else has to be real time too. You're putting a lot of effort into testing something that is practically meaningless in the real world. Like a mechanic who vigorously tests only engine performance but ignores weight, aerodynamics, brakes and so on and concludes that the car will be great in a race. Or what else is the purpose of those videos? Why should thousands of people watch it? To not drawing any real conclusions? I think any local latency lower than 8-15ms is practically nullified because of tick rate. No matter how fast the local game is, it has to wait for the next tick anyway. And the sub tick isn't self-salvation either. But maybe I'm wrong. But we don't know because you haven't tested it.",negative

24,"4:38 battlenonsense is correct here, the tearing at the bottom happens because framelimiters don't always delay the next frame long enough to meet or exceed your monitors refresh duration. even fps limited you will still get some frames coming in more quickly than your monitor can refresh a single frame, leading to the shown tearing at the bottom. vsync is needed to ensure it doesn't happen, which would lead to that single frame that was produced more quickly being shown a tad bit later, effectively waiting for the monitor to finish refreshing the previous frame. this also causes some small latency penalty when it happens",negative

It's called a Faraday cage and it's one of those physics things that seems like it shouldn't work at all but it works really well. And it's the reason you don't get cooked when you cook food in a microwave.

41,"I guess my previous comment got blocked for some reason. A few quick google searches would've at least made this video educational on how wireless works, but at least good to know manufacturers are thinking about this. Most consumer wireless (your headphone, your mouse, your keyboard etc.) devices operate in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, that includes Bluetooth as well. Guess what frequency a microwave oven works at - 2.4 GHz. Not sure if it's the mouse you were using that's operating at different frequency or if the microwave oven had better shielding than most, but these signals will interfere with each other.

I had that issue with my superlight because I plugged the usb receiver directly into my pc, which is close to a router. I was getting tracking that was skipping and getting interrupted. Plugging the usb receiver in to the lightspeed dongle and putting the dongle further away from the router fixed it.

It's not even an unusual scenario. In some apartment buildings for example there will be dozens of routers of varying strengths all blasting into your apartment. You will often notice wifi being so unreliable in that scenario you are forced to use a network cable to get playable gameplay.

64,"maybe that one commenter meant hardware vs software gsync, not vsync.  gsync compatible is software, as are nearly all laptops with gsync (there's a handful of laptops from 9xx/10xx nvidia gtx series that have a hardware gsync module, it's an fpga embedded inside the machine.  actual gsync desktop monitors also use hardware, an fpga board inside.  there is very little difference between the experience on a good gsync compatible monitor and a monitor with hardware gsync, and you get additional points of failure for that added complexity.  my first and only hardware gsync monitor lasted four years.  my freesync monitor running in software gsync forced on (it's not officially compatible) is just as good an experience and has lasted almost five years now with no issues.  you do have to careful and ensure the sync range is reasonably wide, your high end of your sync range around 2.2x the low end (for me, it's a 48hz min range, 170hz max (overclock) so it's more than enough to have a smooth experience.  the whole talk of gsync on, vsync on, cap set to 3fps less than max refresh, it's possibly some relic of old drivers and practices to avoid bugs that existed a long time ago.  you also run into confirmation bias, many people think they know what will work best, so they feel they get a better experience when they set it up that way.",positive

68,"You saying at 3:52 ""Vsync isn't on if your framerate is below your refresh rate"" is just patently false. You can literally test this at 60hz with an FPS cap lower than that and see that there won't be tearing.

71,"Where is the claim that V-Sync turns off when Free/G-Sync is active? How would the game know that Free/G-Sync is turned off in that case?

This has been debunked before by both AMD and Nvidia to which at the same time they recommend having V-Sync on to avoid tearing on the first place because to nobody surprise V-Sync is it's own thing, instead of just a precise framerate cap.. Because funnily enough Nvidia Reflex actually knows when to stop the framerate to avoid input lag when V-Sync is on, at 144hz it stops at around 138 fps.

At any rate, thanks for finally debunking V-Sync having no latency when it's used properly.

For those curious, on AMD GPU with Freesync all you need is RTSS capped about 1-2 frames lower to get it going perfectly.

For Nvidia users you need to do the same but also set Low Latency mode to Ultra (Which used to be called max pre-rendered frames with 5 to 1 frames as a choice.).",neutral

When I ran cs2 for the first time, I noticed that the mouse movement is very sluggish compared to csgo, everything else was fine.
I just don't know how to test mouse movement input delay properly without having proper dev tools...

180,"Optics/Electrical Engineering grad student here, glad you got to hear more about the Shanon-Nyquist theorem! Just a small nit-pick on your verbiage, the sampling theorem is still accurate, but because pixels don't update at the frequency of your refresh rate, the fundamental frequency you are trying to sample is larger. Hence, to obtain un-aliased measurements, you must sample at a frequency twice as fast as the frequency of the pixel updates to be able to fully measure how the monitor is displaying information.

This is the essence of what you said, but the theorem doesn't have an issue, it just that the frequency components of the signal from the display updating exceed the monitor refresh rate because the monitor doesn't update globally.

Sorry for being pedantic, just thought I would put a bit more precise language in a comment. I always love what you publish and admire the care you take to make accurate and informative content. No joke, your content has really inspired me with my academics because of how relevant the content I study is to the topics you discuss.

183,"I was one of the people who wrote that I use Gsync + Vsync + Frame cap (alternatively nvidia reflex). From my understanding Gsync by itself does not prevent tearing, it only syncs the refresh rate to the framerate. Tearing can still occur because of individual frametime variances. Vsync should introduce little to no latency when gsync is used and the framerate is below the monitor's refresh rate. I assume you've read the blurbusters gsync article, but if not, I recommend giving it a look. But I do have to say this whole debate about the optimal gsync setup is very confusing and seems that everyone says something different. That's why people often refer to the blurbusters article, because they are quite a trustworthy authority on this, at least compared to anecdotal evidence and random Reddit comments.",neutral

188,"Having tearing appear only near the bottom of the monitor with G-Sync on and V-Sync off makes sense, as the fps limiter is *mostly* doing its job, and just sometimes letting frames get rendered slightly too early, i.e. just before the current frame scanout finishes. And the scanout always goes from top to bottom.

Also, the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem doesn't apply here because the signal you are sampling, i.e. the pixel response of the monitor, is not a band-limited signal. For example, if you imagine a perfect monitor with instant pixel response times, and the image just changes between black and white on every frame, the result is a square wave, which is well-known to have infinite bandwidth. Intuitively: If you capture one sample where the pixel is perfectly black, and on the next sample it's perfectly white, there is no way for you to know at which exact instant between these two samples the change happened. And even if the theorem did apply, the result simply means that you can reconstruct the signal perfectly via interpolation, which is not being done here.",neutral

234,"I built my own latency analyzer, and I noticed these latency analyzer flash indictors are not accurate at all. The nvidia Indicator works the same as the rtss flash Indicator. I tested the rtss flash indicator in many games. It can't pick up many changes that got applied to the system. For example when playing a game in borderless fullscreen. It usually introduces 5-10ms lag (or more depending on the game). The rtss marker ""ignores"" this and shows me the same results as with fullscreen mode.

While yes, it uses a 3D api hook, but the problem is, it's not FULLY integrated into the game engine, and that's why i'm seeing these results.
Nvidia for example has a implementation of it's own Flash Indicator that is integrated into certain game engines, that needs to be enabled in the settings and it's known to be more accurate then the rtss/geforce experience flash marker.

That's also most likely why you see lower input lag in CS2 compared to CS:S, despite CS:S probably having a much higher frame rate then CS2 and the game engine of CS:S doesn't need to proccess as many things. Doesn't make quiet sense why CS:2 should have lower lag overall.

Overall it's still a good way of testing general input delay, but it lacks of precision.",negative

To put it simply, your CPU, RAM, GPU/VRAM has their own memory bandwith which is basically just how much data can be transferred between memory and the processor.
Basically CPUs and GPUs can process way more data then they can be fed. Well... if the game is not optimized well.

Using SIMD design patterns can help with optimizing, but obviously unless you get the sourcecode of the game, modify it yourself and then compile it there is nothing you can do.

This is why even if none of your components are sitting at 100% utilization but you upgrade your PC you can still get higher FPS.",neutral

When my headset is near a microwave it picks up crackles, in theory the microwave could interfere with the mouse's signal and influence the movement information.

267,"4:50 You are wrong here, Philip! G-Sync alone WILL NOT STOP this “bottom of screen” tearing, v-sync must be used as well. This is not a monitor issue, this is not a game issue, this is just how G-sync was implemented. It has always been this way. Enabling v-sync has no negative effect in this scenario, so there is no reason to leave it off if you are experiencing this “bottom of screen” tearing situation with G-sync. In fact, if you are using G-sync, there is no reason to leave V-sync off at all, ever! Because if you’re uncapped, you should just leave G-sync off since it does nothing. And if you’re capped, V-sync ON is never an issue. G-sync ON + V-sync OFF is a pointless configuration - extra tearing for no input lag benefit, unless you count the torn frame at the bottom of the screen as “lower” input lag, since technically that section at the bottom is from a newer frame. I don’t think anyone would actually benefit from that, though…",negative

288,"The best practice for using V-sync and G-sync and an FPS cap is to cap your monitors refresh rate to it's maximum -6.8%. This is the advice given on Blur Busters and they go in to great detail explaining why this has the minimal latency impact (on a 360Hz screen it's like 1ms, as you've shown) whilst producing no tears. This is what I do, with Nvidia control panel V-sync as my chosen way of implementing V-sync. I think overall, this is the best way to do it. V-sync isn't flicking off and on, as the framerate never goes above and below the maximum refresh rate of the display (it's why they recommend -6.8%, as in-engine and even external caps aren't perfect) and g-sync is always on as you're within that boundary too, and therefore the latency impact from both features toggling off and on again is mitigated. Very happy you tested this, just wanted to point you to some extra reading if you're interested - Google 'Blur Busters G-Sync 101' and go to page 14 of the article if you want to read more from a reputable source.

Also, it's recommended to use Nvidia Reflex + Boost, which of course makes Nvidia Low Latency mode (in Nvidia control panel) redundant - in theory this sets the -6.8% framerate cap for you, but often breaks. Either way, the way it makes the render queue just one frame is good for latency, so it's recommended, and you might as well leave low latency mode on in the control panel anyway for the benefit of other games that don't have Reflex built into them.",positive
