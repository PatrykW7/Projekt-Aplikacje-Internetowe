0,68.5fps in TW3 NG? Come on buddy thats not gonna get you a thumbs up is it? For sure you could have adjusted 1 slider a tiny bit to hit the sweet spot?,Negatywny
1,you seen the oem only r5 7500f's mate?,Neutralny
2,"Personally I would aim for one of the ""Engineers Specials"" on Aliexpress with a i9 or i7 permanently welded to a DDR5 motherboard, not sff but a last gen i9 is going to kick the ooshies out of much on the market pretty much.",Neutralny
3,It'd be perfect for sff NAS builds as well. Cool,Pozytywny
4,"For that ridiculous price, no way.... I'd rather take the time to find cheaper parts and build a more expandable system. That website has garbage prices on most everything offered. I'm glad I live in the States, with electronics choices in mass abundance.",Negatywny
5,Lol given the size of that cpu cooler 80s 90s it's just pathetic laptops use tiny coolers  so not sure what minis forum is talking about,Negatywny
6,nice video,Pozytywny
7,"For $400 it's actually objectively worth it's price. Plus finding an ITX board with good VRMs right now is hard, just because socket sizes are so big now, so using a mobile APU actually makes sense.",Pozytywny
8,The buffet plate is 12.50,Neutralny
9,"What's the dimensions of this boy?
miniITX is the boards formfactor so 170mm x 170mm - but how thick is it? Thinking about getting something like this but minisforum have absolutely buggerall information about this.",Negatywny
10,DDR5 and the price of RAM is finally making iGPUs live up to e-sports 1080p60! R.I.P. $200 and under GPUs...,Pozytywny
11,"Oh I didn't realize minisforum was producing standalone motherboards! I've seen their mini PCs for the last couple of years and wanted to get them, but this is an interesting proposition. Look at those heatsinks!",Pozytywny
12,Its it really that small or have you had an allergic reaction to   the Melvaran mud flea vaccine  and your hands have swollen up to an unfeasibly large size,Negatywny
13,"About the cpu temps, unless you go in the bios and tinker with the temp target/boost (if the motherboard allows) they will target 95c regardless of cooling being used (all ryzen 7000 are designed like this), you can hookup a high end water cooler or even do custom water cooling, but unless you tinker in the bios, it will target 95c, jayz2cents has a video about this if you want to take a look",Neutralny
14,"lol I‚Äôm the opposite with R* games, I‚Äôm used to 1st person so third is weird to me. I always prefer first person if I‚Äôm given a choice.",Neutralny
15,This thing would be dope for an all in one emulation machine!,Pozytywny
16,This is a fan that comes with a computer,Neutralny
17,I have been eyeing this board... perfect time for a review. Such an interesting little thing.,Pozytywny
18,You're not giving the credit that the 3060ti deserves. It's one of the best gpus Nvidia put out last few years. It literally runs everything at 1440p.,Pozytywny
19,"Yeah, I use Lenovo Legion Pro 5 (2023) with this CPU and it‚Äôs extremely hot during gaming. Temperatures at high 80 in Silent mode and hitting 100 degrees ceilings in Performance mode",Pozytywny
20,"You should unlock the fps on elden ring, there's many ways to do it, if you do just mention what was used to unlock it- I use Flawless Widescreen. Seems a bit pointless using it as a benchmark without that. Love all your videos, I hope you never stop :D",Pozytywny
21,"To expand on the temperature thing, that's by design for Ryzen 7000 Zen 4 parts, the boost algorithms are tuned to thermal boosting, the chips will target 95c regardless of what cooling you use.",Neutralny
22,"I'm absolutely amazed that an 8C/16T CPU at 5.1GHz is even staying below 80C to be honest. That's a bonkers amount of power shoved into such a tiny chip, with such a dinky cooler too. Amazing performance for its power usage.",Pozytywny
23,"Did you check the PCIe Slot? My Board seems only to deliver PCIe 1.0/1.1... checked with CPU-Z, GPU-Z and HWiNFO64... idle or full load... it always just shows PCIe 1.0/1.1 x16... GPU used is an Inno3d RTX 4070 Ti X3 OC.",Neutralny
24,I wish there is a 7945HX version of this board available as it would make an awesome home server.,Pozytywny
25,"i just got mine yesterday, looking forward to its performance in a custom itx build.",Pozytywny
26,this motherboard would be pefrect for gigabyte rtx 4060 mini  so you can buil a stealth mini gaming pc,Neutralny
27,"Wow, I have been eyeing this board for a while now. It reminds me of the aliexpress erying motherboards but AMD instead of intel. I am tempted to wait for the Ryzen 9 variant just for the additional cores. 
I would love to do a build with this and a 4070 (when its cheap) for an energy efficient build. However I still would have to do research on these types of boards and weigh some pro's and cons, because I don't want to regret it later down the road.",Pozytywny
28,I would say the temps are not too bad when you take the clocks into account.,Pozytywny
29,that fan looks huge,Pozytywny
30,"Eight cores in that form factor, with a working x16 PCIe slot, for that price? That thing could make the basis for a very nice small home server.",Pozytywny
31,Good stuff üëåüëç,Pozytywny
32,Perfect for a mini sleeper üëç.,Pozytywny
33,I was just looking on amazon and found this motherboard and when I look for a review on YT. It was already on my home page üòÆ,Pozytywny
34,Something like this will be replacing my emulator machine in my living room once my work horse xeon finally dies.,Neutralny
35,Theoretically this is exactly what I need for a custom project I've had in mind for years. A mini pc in the case of a Playstation2,Pozytywny
36,"I mean that Board is cool, but you could get a mini itx Board with AM4/5 Socket and go for a Desktop apu with a low profile cooler etc.
Wouldn't be really better, but much more Upgradeable",Pozytywny
37,love your videos !,Pozytywny
38,"It could be a nice powerful ITX build, oh wow!",Pozytywny
39,That thing is actually pretty cool. Might be pretty good for a multimedia station,Pozytywny
